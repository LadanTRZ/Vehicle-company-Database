# Vehicle Company Database
VehicleCoDB: The project entails the creation of a comprehensive database tailored for a vehicle company, catering to the needs of individuals, startups, or small businesses within the automotive industry. The database design encompasses tables for storing essential information about manufacturers, vehicle categories, vehicles themselves, customers, and orders.
At its core, the database aims to provide a structured and efficient means of managing various aspects of the vehicle business, including inventory tracking, customer relations, and order management. By adhering to best practices in database design, such as normalization and establishing appropriate relationships between tables, the database ensures data integrity, reliability, and scalability.
The Manufacturers table is a repository for manufacturer details, including their names and countries of origin. This table facilitates the organization and retrieval of information regarding the entities responsible for producing vehicles within the database.
The Vehicle Categories table categorizes vehicles into distinct types, such as sedans, SUVs, and trucks. This classification enables efficient grouping and filtering of vehicles based on their intended use or characteristics.
The Vehicles table stores comprehensive information about individual vehicles, including their manufacturers, categories, models, production years, colors, and prices. This table forms the core of the database, allowing users to track inventory, manage pricing, and analyze trends in vehicle sales.
The Customers table maintains records of customers interacting with the vehicle company, storing details such as their names and email addresses. This table facilitates customer relationship management and enables personalized communication and targeted marketing efforts.
The Orders table tracks the orders placed by customers, linking specific vehicles to individual customers along with order dates, and total prices. This table enables efficient order processing.
The Orders_Status table holds the orders' status, linking specific orders along with completion statuses and completion dates. This table enables efficient order processing, status tracking, and analysis of sales performance.
Additionally, the database includes several views to facilitate data retrieval and analysis. Views such as Vehicle Details, Order Details, Order Status, DelayedCompletedOrders, and Net Income Profit provide users with pre-defined queries for accessing relevant information about vehicles, orders, and customer interactions.
Furthermore, the project includes instructions for populating the database with sample data using INSERT INTO statements. These statements demonstrate how to populate the tables with realistic data, enabling users to explore the database's functionality and capabilities.
